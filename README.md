# LeagueModel
An application to display League of Legends models on Windows.

## How do I use it?

Simply download one of the releases, found [here](https://github.com/Querijn/LeagueModel/releases). If you've installed League of Legends in its default location (`C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\`), you can just run it from anywhere. If you haven't, you need to put the binary inside the League of Legends folder, or you need to supply the League of Legends path as the first argument.

Make sure that you have write access to the folder you're running it from, since it will create a `cache` folder with the cache files it needs to keep track of.

## How do I compile it?

For PC:
- Get CMake, and run the GUI. The Visual Studio 2022 generators work, tested for x64.
- Run it, generate it, and open the project.
- Compile and run it.
